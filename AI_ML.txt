--> Artificial intelligence: 
        Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems which are able to perform tasks just like human intelligence.
    Examples:
        Self driving cars, Speech Recogniton, Virtual Assistant, Spam Filters, Chatbots etc

--> Types of Artificial intelligence:   
    -> Generative AI:
        It is used to create new content such as images, vedios, music and code.
    Examples:
        ChatGPT, DALL-E, jukebox etc.
                              
    -> Visual AI:
        It is used to see and explain visual information or data that human do.
    Examples:
        Self driving cars, Facial Recogniton, Medical imaging analysis etc.

    -> Agentic AI:
        It is used to Perform tasks which makes decision, think, plan and act independently.
    Examples:
        AutoGPT, Siri, Google Assistant, AI Chatbots etc.                     
    -> Conversational AI:
        It is used to understand and generate response on the basis of User Input.
    Examples:
        ChatGPT, Alexa, Google Assistant etc
    -> Autonomous AI Systems:
        It is used to plan, think and perform tasks independently without using human interaction.
    Examples: 
       Self driving cars, Delivery drones, Robotic vaccum cleaner etc
    -> etc              

--> Large Language Model(LLMs) vs Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAGs)

| Feature    | LLM(Large Language Model)     | RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation)
|---------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Focus | It is an powerful AI model which is used for training to understand and generate text. | It is AI framework which enhaces accuracy and response generated text by LLM. |
| Main Goal | It's generate text based on  given prompt using its training data.          | It provides more accurate response using external information. |
| Key Technologies | Deep learning, transformers, NLP(Natural Language Processing).                | Combination of LLM + vector databases or search engines.  |
| Models | GPT-3, GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA, etc.                            | RAG by Facebook(Meta), LangChain, OpenAI, Hugging Face. |
| Examples  | ChatGPT, Google Bard                                    | ChatGPT, AI assistants.                      |

--> Machine learning:
      It is the set of smart algorithm that learn from data to solve complex problems.
    Examples:
            Self driving cars, Handwitten Recogniton, Checker game etc.

->> Types of Machine learning:
     -> Supervised learning: 
       It is the type of machine learning in which we have labeled data
     Examples: 
            Spam filtering, House price prediction, Medical diagnosis etc.
     -> Unsupervised learning:
       It is the type of machine learning in which we have unlabeled data.
     Examples:
           Customer Segmentation, Anamoly Detection, Social Network Analysis 
     -> Reinforcement learning: 
        It is the type of machine learning which is revert back learning in which agent take an action on enviroment will give reward or penalty to them.
     Examples:
        Game Playing, Robotics etc
     -> Semi-Supervised learning:
         It is the type of machine learning in which we have labeled as well as unlabeled data.
     Examples:
        Email Classification, Medical imaging etc
     -> Self-Supervised learning:
        It is the type of Unsupervised learning in which system generates labels as a Input data to create supervised  learning problem.
     Examples:
        Voice Assistant, Text Embeddings for search etc
     -> Transfer learning:
      It used pre-trained model and its help  to solve the same problem.
     Examples:
       Custom Object Detection by using yolo, Facil Recogniton etc
     -> Active learning:
      It is used to allow model to select or query the most important data sample that is labeled by human. 
     Examples:
       Document Classification, Road object detection for Autonomous cars etc
