->> Types of Machine learning:
     -> Supervised learning: 
       It is the type of machine learning in which we have labeled data
     Examples: 
            Spam filtering, House price prediction, Medical diagnosis etc.
     -> Unsupervised learning:
       It is the type of machine learning in which we have unlabeled data.
     Examples:
           Customer Segmentation, Anamoly Detection, Social Network Analysis 
     -> Reinforcement learning: 
        It is the type of machine learning which is revert back learning in which agent take an action on enviroment will give reward or penalty to them.
     Examples:
        Game Playing, Robotics etc
     -> Semi-Supervised learning:
         It is the type of machine learning in which we have labeled as well as unlabeled data.
     Examples:
        Email Classification, Medical imaging etc
     -> Self-Supervised learning:
        It is the type of Unsupervised learning in which system generates labels as a Input data to create supervised  learning problem.
     Examples:
        Voice Assistant, Text Embeddings for search etc
     -> Transfer learning:
      It used pre-trained model and its help  to solve the same problem.
     Examples:
       Custom Object Detection by using yolo, Facil Recogniton etc
     -> Active learning:
      It is used to allow model to select or query the most important data sample that is labeled by human. 
     Examples:
       Document Classification, Road object detection for Autonomous cars etc

--> Algorithms and Models:
   -> Supervised learning:
      -> Linear Regression:
        It is an algorithm that provides a Linear relationship between dependent and independent variables to predict future outcomes.
     Example: 
        We want to predict a studentâ€™s exam score based on how many hours they studied.
      -> Logistic Regression:
        It is an algorithm that is used for classification tasks in which it predicts the probability between two factors.
     Example:
        Predict whether a person has diabetis or not based on their blood sugar test.    
      -> Decision Tree:
        It is Used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds a tree-like model of decisions and possible outcomes.
     Example: 
        Predicting whether a person will play tennis based on  weather conditions.   
      -> Random Forest:
        It is Ensumble learning Method that works for classification and regression tasks by creating multitude decision trees  during training.
     Example: 
       Spam detection, Image classification, Disease prediction.
      -> K-NN (K-Nearest Networks):
        It is supervised machine learning algorithm which is used to predict outputs for a data point based on majority or average of its neighbors during training. 
     Example:
       Image recognition, Medical diagnosis.
