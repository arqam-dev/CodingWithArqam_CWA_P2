--> Artificial intelligence: 
        Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems which are able to perform tasks just like human intelligence.
    Examples:
        Self driving cars, Speech Recogniton, Virtual Assistant, Spam Filters, Chatbots etc

--> Types of Artificial intelligence:   
    -> Generative AI:
        It is used to create new content such as images, vedios, music and code.
    Examples:
        ChatGPT, DALL-E, jukebox etc.
                              
    -> Visual AI:
        It is used to see and explain visual information or data that human do.
    Examples:
        Self driving cars, Facial Recogniton, Medical imaging analysis etc.

    -> Agentic AI:
        It is used to Perform tasks which makes decision, think, plan and act independently.
    Examples:
        AutoGPT, Siri, Google Assistant, AI Chatbots etc.                     
    -> Conversational AI:
        It is used to understand and generate response on the basis of User Input.
    Examples:
        ChatGPT, Alexa, Google Assistant etc
    -> Autonomous AI Systems:
        It is used to plan, think and perform tasks independently without using human interaction.
    Examples: 
       Self driving cars, Delivery drones, Robotic vaccum cleaner etc
    -> etc              

--> Large Language Model(LLMs) vs Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAGs)

| **Feature**   |**LLM(Large Language Model)**      |**RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
|---------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|**Focus** | It is an powerful AI model which is used for training to understand and generate text. | It is AI framework which enhaces accuracy and response generated by LLM. |
|**Main Goal** | It's generate text based on  given prompt using its training data.          | It provides more accurate response using external information. |
|**Key Technologies**| Deep learning, transformers, NLP(Natural Language Processing).                | Combination of LLM + vector databases or search engines.  |
|**Models** | GPT-3, GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA, etc.                            | RAG by Facebook(Meta), LangChain, OpenAI, Hugging Face. |
|**Examples** | ChatGPT, Google Bard                                    | ChatGPT, AI assistants.                      |
