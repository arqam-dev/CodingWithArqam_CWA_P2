--> Cybersecurity Core Concepts:
  -> CIA Trade (Confidentially, Integrity, Availability):
      -> Confidentially:
            It ensures that only authorize users can access data.
         Example:
             Encrypting a file So only users with the key can read it.
         Integrity:
            It ensures that data is accurate and unchanged.
         Example:
             Modifying a bank balance without permissions.
         Availability:
            It ensures that system and data are accessible when it needed.
         Example:
            Using backup servers to maintain uptime during hardware failure.
          
  -> Authentication Vs Authoriztion:
      -> Authentication:
           It must confirm the user's identity.
         Example:
           Logging in with username and password.
      -> Authoriztion:
          It gives access to resources based on identity.
         Example:
            A logged-in user can view their profile but not access to admin settings.

  -> Types of Threats:
      -> Malware:
          Malicious that damaged or gain unauthorized access to system.
         Example:
           A virus that deletes files.
      -> Phishing:
           Fake messages tricking  users into giving user personal info.
         Example:
           Fake bank email asking for login details.
      -> Ransomware:
           Lock data and demands  payment to unlock it.
         Example:
           You cannot access your file untill you pay to ransom.
      -> SQL Injection:
           Insert harmful SQL to input fields to access Databases. 
         Example:
           Login form hacked to reveal user data. 
      -> Cross-Site Scripting(XSS):
           Injecting malicious scripting into webpages.
         Example:
           Script in a block comment steals user cookies.
      -> Man-in-the-Middle:
           Monitoring data between two parties.
         Example:
           Hacker eavesdrops on public WI-FI traffic.
      -> Deniel of Service(DDoS/Dos):
           Overloads a system to making it slow or unavailable to real users.
         Example:
           A website crashes due to too many fake visits. 
      -> Zero Day Exploit:
           Attacked on unknown software bugs.
         Example:
           Hacker exploits a browser flaw before it's fixed.
      -> Insider Threat:
           Attack or leak from someone within organization.
         Example:
           Employee leaks Confidential data.
      -> Advenced Persistent Threat:
           Attackers stay hidden and continuously steal data. 
         Example:
           Hacker secretly monitor government network.
      -> Internet Of Thing(IoT):
           Tragerting flaws in IoT devices.
          Example:
            Hacker access your home camera system.

  -> Firewall:
      Monitors and filters incoming/outgoing network traffic based on security.
     Example:
       A firewall blocks access to unauthorized websites from the company network.

  -> IDS(Intrusion Detection System):
       It detect and alert suspicious actvity in a network.
     Example:
       It raises alert when it detect a port scanning attempt.

  -> IPS(Intrusion Prevention System):
       It detect and block suspicious actvity in a network at real time.
     Example:
       It block DDoS attack before it reaches to server. 

-> Data and System Protection:
  -> Encryption:
      It convert data into unreadable form to protect it from unauthorized access.
     Example:
      An email can be Encrypted with PGP can only be read by intended recipient.

  -> Symmetric VS Asymmetric:

    -> Symmetric:
         It uses one key which is private key.
       Example: 
        AES is symmetric which is same key.

    -> Asymmetric: 
        It uses public-private key.
       Example:
        RSA is asymmetric which uses public/private keys.

  -> Hashing:
      It converts data into fixed length code to verify integrity, not reversible.
       Example:
        Password are stores in hashes(like SHA-256) in a database.

  -> Public Key Infrastructure:
       Example:
  -> Private Key Infrastructure:
       Example:
  -> Digital Signatures:
      Example:
  -> Data Loss Prevention:
      Example:
  -> Secure File Transfer Methods:
      -> SFTP:
      -> FTPS:
      -> HTTPS:
