--> Cybersecurity Core Concepts:
  -> CIA Trade (Confidentially, Integrity, Availability):
      -> Confidentially:
            It ensures that only authorize users can access data.
         Example:
             Encrypting a file So only users with the key can read it.
         Integrity:
            It ensures that data is accurate and unchanged.
         Example:
             Modifying a bank balance without permissions.
         Availability:
            It ensures that system and data are accessible when it needed.
         Example:
            Using backup servers to maintain uptime during hardware failure.
          
  -> Authentication Vs Authoriztion:
      -> Authentication:
           It must confirm the user's identity.
         Example:
           Logging in with username and password.
      -> Authoriztion:
          It gives access to resources based on identity.
         Example:
            A logged-in user can view their profile but not access to admin settings.

  -> Types of Cybersecurity:

  -> Firewall:
      Monitors and filters incoming/outgoing network traffic based on security.
     Example:
       A firewall blocks access to unauthorized websites from the company network.

  -> IDS(Intrusion Detection System):
       It detect and alert suspicious actvity in a network.
     Example:
       It raises alert when it detect a port scanning attempt.

  -> IPS(Intrusion Prevention System):
       It detect and block suspicious actvity in a network at real time.
     Example:
       It block DDoS attack before it reaches to server. 

  -> Encryption:
      It convert data into unreadable form to protect it from unauthorized access.
     Example:
      An email can be Encrypted with PGP can only be read by intended recipient.

  -> Symmetric VS Asymmetric:
  
    -> Symmetric:
         It uses one key which is private key.
       Example: 
        AES is symmetric which is same key.

    -> Asymmetric: 
        It uses public-private key.
       Example:
        RSA is asymmetric which uses public/private keys 

  -> Hashing:
      It converts data into fixed length code to verify integrity, not reversible.
       Example:
        Password are stores in hashes(like SHA-256) in a database.
